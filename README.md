# face_detection

This is a try using OpenCV to detect human faces and eyes ( inside of the face only haha , and not around it or in the background "maybe there is a drawing that have eyes on it").

You here can see that not only face or the eye that have been detected , it’s also your pretty smile has been detected.

#### Simple CAUTION 

If you’re wearing eyeglasses like me you can see that the accuracy isn't the best and it may catch your cheeks as your eyes haha.

thank U ^_^
