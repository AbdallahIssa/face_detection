# face detection

This is a try using OpenCV to detect human faces and eyes within your laptop camera 'video'
(inside of the face only haha , and not around it or in the background "maybe there is a drawing that have eyes on it").

You here can see that not only face or the eye that have been detected , it’s also your pretty smile has been detected.

#### Simple CAUTION 

If you’re wearing eyeglasses like me you can see that the accuracy isn't the best and it may catch your cheeks as your eyes haha.

You’ll just open Face_Detection.ipynb file with jupyter Notebook and you’ll see the code.

Also attached here the "After" and "Before" smile detection pictures.

thank U ^_^
